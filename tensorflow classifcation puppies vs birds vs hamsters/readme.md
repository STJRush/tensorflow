To use:

In the datasets/train/images folder,
you need to put your training images into folders eg. dog, cat

In the datasets/test/images folder,
you need to put different TEST images into the SAME folders eg. dog, cat

You should have at least 10 images in each folder (and probably should have thousands)

This will allow to to train your model.

To test your model with another image you can call it test1.jpg and put it here:

datasets/test/my_test_images/test1.jpg
